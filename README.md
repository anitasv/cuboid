# Cuboid

Implements a solution to Problem 212, Project Euler. It is a very old problem,
so I hope I am not violating any rules. This is not a very performant 
implementation, identical java implementation was 17 times faster (zig: 4 seconds, java: 51 seconds 
vs clojure: 883 seconds). 

I did mostly to learn clojure than solving the problem itself. 

## Usage

For quick testing:

    $ lein run 10

For full speed execution

    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar ./target/uberjar/cuboid-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar 50000
